The liberties of the enslaved peoples of New Jersey were formally curtailed under a law passed in 1704 , a so-called 'slave code ' .
This code prohibited the owning of property by slaves and by free African Americans as well .
In addition , it made certain actions illegal for African Americans , like staying out past curfew , that were not illegal for European Americans.. Camden was a center for the importation of slaves , its ferry docks on the Delaware River across from Philadelphia acting as auction sites for the plantations in the Delaware Valley , of which Pomona Hall was one..
In 2016 Rutgers University published a report `` Scarlet and Black '' recording the university 's relationship with slavery .
In 2017 Princeton University made public the findings of the Princeton & Slavery Project , which is ongoing.. African-American slaves fought on both sides in the War for Independence .
The British Crown promised slaves freedom for leaving their rebel masters to join their cause .
The number of blacks in New York rose to 10,000 as slaves escaped there from both northern and southern masters after the British occupied the city .
The British kept their promise and evacuated thousands of freedmen from New York , resettling 3,500 Black Loyalists in its colony of Nova Scotia and others in the Caribbean islands .
Colonel Tye , also known as Titus Cornelius ( c. 1753–1780 ) , was a slave of African descent who achieved notability during the war by his leadership and fighting skills , and was one of the most effective guerrilla leaders opposing the American rebel forces in Central Jersey..
Following the Revolutionary War in the 1780s , New Jersey initially resisted the urge to free slaves due to a desire to re-build their devastated economy .
According to the American historian Giles Wright , by 1790 New Jersey 's enslaved population numbered approximately 14,000 .
The 1790 federal census , however , recorded 11,423 slaves , 6.2 percent of the total population of 184,139 .
In the decades before the Revolution , slaves were numerous near Perth Amboy , the primary point of entry for New Jersey , and in the eastern counties .
Slaves were generally used for agricultural labor , but they also filled skilled artisan jobs in shipyards and industry in coastal cities..
Following the Revolutionary War , New Jersey banned the importation of slaves in 1788 , but at the same time forbade free blacks from elsewhere from settling in the state .
In the first two decades after the war many northern states made moves towards abolishing slavery , and some slaveholders independently manumitted their slaves .
Some people of color left the areas where they had been enslaved and moved to more frontier areas .
Since slaves were widely used in agriculture , as well as the ports , the New Jersey state legislature was the last in the North to abolish slavery , passing a law in 1804 for its gradual abolition .
The 1804 statute and subsequent laws freed children born after the law was passed .
African Americans born to slave mothers after July 4 , 1804 had to serve lengthy apprenticeships to the owners of their mothers .
Women were freed at 21 , but men were not emancipated until the age of 25 .
Slaves who had been born before these laws were passed were considered , after 1846 , as indentured servants who were `` apprenticed for life . `` .
Although at first New Jersey allowed free people of color to vote , the legislature disfranchised them in 1807 , an exclusion that lasted until 1875 .
By 1830 two-thirds of the slaves remaining in the North were held by masters in New Jersey , as New York had freed the last of its slaves in 1827 under gradual abolition .
It was not until 1846 that New Jersey abolished slavery , but it qualified it by redefining former slaves as apprentices who were `` apprenticed for life '' to their masters .
Slavery did not truly end in the state until it was ended nationally in 1865 after the American Civil War and passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution..
According to historian James Gigantino ( University of Arkansas ) , during the early nineteenth century in New Jersey , there were more female than male slaves .
After the passage of the `` Act of Gradual Abolition in New Jersey in 1804 '' , a greater number of advertisements in the state for the full-title sale of female slaves of child-bearing age were published .
Female slaves and their reproductive capabilities were highly valuable because their children would be born as slaves for a term , even after the 1804 Act of Gradual Abolition .
However , domestic skills and labor also affected the value and marketability of female slaves .
By 1830 , African Americans made up 6 % of the total population of New Jersey .
The city of New Brunswick had a large African American population at an around 11 % .
This added one of the reasons why New Brunswick was a favorable location for runaways , but it also made the city into a popular site for slave hunters , who wished to enforce the federal fugitive slave laws of 1850 .
In more urban areas of the state , like New Brunswick , there were frequent advertisements for the sale of female slaves , both before and after passage of the 1804 Act of Gradual Abolition .
This was because female slaves were more highly favored for domestic work , which was in greater demand in urban spaces like New Brunswick .
Enslaved women , however , also performed manual labor across the state of New Jersey..
Yet the Gradual Abolition Act of 1804 did not guarantee that a slave born after 1804 would gain their freedom .
Slaveholders would regularly sell those slaves down south to states like Louisiana before the slaves reached manumission age .
By the 1830s , slavery was on the decline in New Jersey.. Communities of free negros and freedmen formed at Dunkerhook in Paramus and at the New York state line at Skunk Hollow , also called The Mountain .
A founding African-American settler bought land there in 1806 , and later bought more .
Other families joined him , and the community continued into the twentieth century .
According to the historian David S. Cohen in `` The Ramapo Mountain People '' ( 1974 ) , free people of color migrated from Manhattan into other parts of the frontier of northeastern New Jersey , where some intermarried and became ancestors of the Ramapo Mountain Indians .
( Cohen 's findings have been disputed by some scholars , including Albert J .
According to Gigantino , one in ten slaves in New Jersey remained enslaved for life .
Many slaveholders sold their slaves to Southern slaveholders , and displayed antipathy toward abolition .
He stated that about one quarter of New Jersey 's African American population was forced into labor during the 1830s .
Improper information regarding who was free led to it appearing as though slavery decreased more rapidly than it actually did.. A total of 2,909 United States Colored Troops from New Jersey served in the Union Army .
Because of the state 's long-term apprenticeship requirements , at the close of the American Civil War , some African Americans in New Jersey remained in bondage .
It was not until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed in 1865 that the last 16 slaves in the state were freed..
In the 1860 census , free colored persons in New Jersey numbered 25,318 , about 4 % of the state 's population of 672,035 .
By 1870 the number had increased to 30,658 , but they constituted a smaller percentage of the total population because of the high rate of European immigration .
Overall , New Jersey 's population had increased to 906,096 , with nearly 200,000 European immigrants.. New Jersey was slow to abolish slavery and reluctant to pass the 13th Amendment , which it did in January 1866 .
Some of its industries , such as shoes and clothing , had strong markets in the South supplying planters for their slaves , which was probably a factor.. On March 31 , 1870 Thomas Mundy Peterson ( 1824–1904 ) became the first African American to vote in an election under the just-enacted provisions of the 15th Amendment to the United States Constitution..
In 1875 , `` Jack '' Jackson , described in a newspaper as `` the last slave in New Jersey , '' died at the age of 87 on the Smith family farm at Secaucus .
Abel Smith had manumitted his slaves in 1820 , but Jackson `` refused to accept his liberty '' and remained on the family estate until his death .
By the will of the late Abel Smith , Jackson was interred in the family burial ground..
In 2008 , the New Jersey Legislature acknowledged the state 's role in the history of slavery in the United States..
In 2019 , the Black Caucus of the Legislation initiated efforts to research the role slavery played in the state.. .
The 2005–06 Hong Kong First Division League season was the 94th since its establishment.. .
According to regulations , the bottom two teams , Hong Kong 08 and South China , were required to be relegated to the Second Division .
However , both teams were retained in the top flight next season via HKFA exempted .
Reason for retaining Hong Kong 08 is to give the team better preparation of 2008 Olympics Qualification games .
South China was retained because the club promised to expand its next season 's budget and sign new quality players .
HKFA accepted this and hoped this would improve the competitiveness and attractiveness of the league.. .
Live in Berlin is the title or subtitle of several albums and videos recorded in Berlin , Germany by various artists..
`` High School Never Ends '' is a song by American rock band Bowling for Soup .
The song was the first single from the group 's sixth album , `` The Great Burrito Extortion Case '' , and was released on September 19 , 2006 .
The song deals with the frustration of graduating from high school and seeing that modern popular culture is very similar to the obnoxiously superficial and materialistic culture in high school..
The tune had a prominent outside songwriter , Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne and Tinted Windows , working with the band .
It was heard in the promos in `` The Goldbergs '' spinoff , `` Schooled '' ..
The song contains many references to the pop culture of the time .
Specific celebrities mentioned include Mary-Kate Olsen ( specifically , her alleged eating disorder - `` How did Mary Kate lose all that weight ?
The song satirizes many aspects of today 's society and its scrutiny of celebrity lives..
Directed by Frank Borin , the video focuses on the band members going to their high school reunion , while another version of them performs the song onstage .
They arrive , instantly recognizing people from the past that bullied them .
During a montage , the band gets revenge on their former bullies in situations similar to their high school past..
The first flashback shows Gary Wiseman getting a wedgie by some bullies , who hang him on the flagpole by his underwear .
Gary takes his revenge by grabbing the underwear of the bully and pulling it over his head while he is still wearing it..
The next flashback involves Erik Chandler getting a note reading `` kick me '' taped to his back by a jock .
Erik gets him back by sticking the punch bowl sign ( which simply reads `` PUNCH '' ) on his back ; this starts a queue of people ready to punch the jock , including a nun , a pimp , a cowboy and a knight in armor.. After the sequence of celebrities references , Jaret Reddick invites a guy onstage who had embarrassed him at high school , by pulling down his pants in front of a girl he was obviously keen of , revealing his pink underwear .
Jaret pulls his pants down onstage as his act of revenge .
The popular guy then explodes in embarrassment after a sign stating `` TOO SMALL FOR TV '' appears strategically over his crotch..
Finally , Chris Burney has a flashback of him being slipped a laxative by a cheerleader and manages to get his own back by consuming a massive sub sandwich , a chili removed from his pants , a white mouse , gasoline , and a goldfish .
After jiggling around , he then confronts the popular girl and presents the contents of his stomach upon her–by projectile vomiting .
After Chris ' revenge , the band finishes the song , Jaret sticks his guitar pick to his rather sweaty forehead and the video ends with a disclaimer that states `` No animals or children under 15 were harmed in the making of this video '' .. A separate edit of the song was recorded for Radio Disney , which altered the lyrics throughout : .
On the week of November 25 , 2006 , `` High School Never Ends '' debuted and peaked at number 97 on the `` Billboard '' Hot 100 , before leaving the chart completely .
For the week ending January 28 , 2007 , the song debuted at number 70 on the UK Singles Chart .
It peaked at number 40 the next week and remained on the chart for four weeks..
Leonidas Kestekides ( 1876 - 1948 ) was a Greek chocolate manufacturer , founder of the internationally famous Leonidas company in Belgium .
The company 's primary focus is pralines ( chocolate shells with soft fillings ) , but they also sell marzipan , solid chocolates , and other confectionery.. Leonidas Kestekides was born to Cappadocian Greek parents in Nigde , Cappadocia ( modern-day Turkey ) in 1876 .
Accounts of his early years vary , but it appears that he left Constantinople ( now Istanbul ) , lived in Greece for a while and then went to Italy , where he became a wine merchant .
He struggled financially , so he decided to move to New York City , where he lived from 1893-98 and worked as a confectioner .
In 1910 , he travelled to Belgium to attend the 1910 World Fair in Brussels , where he was awarded the bronze medal for his chocolate confectionery .
He returned to Belgium in 1913 , attended the World Fair in Ghent , and moved permanently to Belgium , having met a young woman from Brussels during his visit .
He opened tea-rooms in Brussels , Ghent and Blankenberge , and the business expanded from there .
Saint Erlembald ( or Erlembaldo Cotta ) ( `` Sanctus Herlembaldus '' in Latin ) ( died 15 April 1075 ) was the political and military leader of the movement known as the `` pataria '' in Milan , a movement to reform the clergy and the church in the Ambrosian diocese..
He was the brother of Landulf , subdeacon of Milan .
They were of the Cotta , a family of valvassores and vassals of the archdiocese .
In his early career , Erlembald was referred to as a `` captain . ''
In 1063 , he returned from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and intended to become a monk when the deacon Ariald convinced him to take his brother 's place at the head of the `` pataria '' .
Erlembald , however , was not a cleric , but a soldier..
In 1064 , he travelled to Rome to confer with Pope Alexander II and confirm his support .
On his return to Milan , he revealed the change in the character of the `` pataria '' by living in a palace near the church of Saint Victor and the Forty Martyrs .
With papal permission he began imposing his will by force on the clergy , by deposing abbots and proceeding against the bishop , Guido da Velate .
Guido was first accused of taking false oaths for not acting against simony in his province .
Guido , however , organised a resistance to the `` patarini '' .
Because of this , Ariald imposed the interdict on the city during the feast of the Ascension .
The populace turned against him and he fled to Pavia .
After being captured en route to Rome , Ariald was executed and his body thrown in Lake Maggiore .
On 3 May 1067 , Erlembald recovered his body and reburied it in S. Celso in Milan on 17 May .
Ariald 's popularity was also recovered after the lifting of the interdict .
A papal legation lent Erlembald much needed moral support at a congregation at Vallambrosa..
In 1069 , Guido renounced the see to Gotofredo da Castiglione with the support of the Emperor Henry IV .
On 7 March 1070 , violence broke out again in Milan and Gotofredo was arrested .
That year , Guido request his archbishopric back from Erlembald .
He was refused , but the `` patarino '' leader put him in S. Celso and then in the see of Bergoglio .
On 6 January 1072 , Erlembald appointed Atto archbishop in opposition to the arrested Gotofredo .
Strong opposition from the German court evaporated suddenly in 1073 when Henry was troubled by revolts in Saxony and had to ceded his rights in Milan to Pope Gregory VII .
Gregory confirmed Atto and lent his support to Erlembald.. At this , the height of his power , an unfortunate fire broke out in the city and was interpreted as divine punishment for supporting the controversial `` pataria '' .
The opposition factions in Milan signed a pact against Erlembald .
He put down the revolt , but was killed in the battle and buried in S. Celso .
From 6 to 26 May in 1095 , Pope Urban II was present at Milan for the transferral of the relics of the canonised Erlembald to S. Dionigi .
He was already a propaganda tool at the time of the preaching of the First Crusade .
He was translated once more in 1528 to the Duomo .

Tanasbourne , Oregon , is a neighborhood in Washington County , Oregon , where NW 185th Avenue and the Sunset Highway ( part of U.S. Highway 26 ) intersect .
The area sits between Beaverton and Hillsboro , and is generally considered to be south of U.S. 26 , north of Walker Road , west of 158th , and east of Cornelius Pass Road .
The area has many shopping areas and is the former home of the defunct Tanasbourne Mall..
In the 1970s Standard Insurance Company developed a large tract of land along the Sunset Highway near 185th Avenue .
The name of the development is a hybrid of the Middle English term `` bourn '' and `` tenas '' from the Chinook Jargon .
The latter term translates as small and the former as creek , giving the term tanasbourne the meaning of small , pretty creeks.. Standard developed an indoor mall at the site , with the mall opening in 1975 .
In 1976 , a library was opened in the community , and in 1990 the city of Hillsboro took over those operations and maintained the branch until 2007 , when it was closed and a new main branch of the Hillsboro Public Library was opened farther west .
In 1983 , the county approved a master plan created by Standard to develop at Tanasbourne .
Hillsboro annexed much of the Tanasbourne area in 1987 .
The next year plans were announced for an expansion of the old mall along with construction of new retail buildings in the area .
The mall was never expanded.. Hillsboro started working to designate the area as a town center within Metro 's planning framework in 1996 .
The Streets of Tanasbourne lifestyle shopping mall opened along Cornell Road in October 2004 after original approval for the project in 2000 .
Hillsboro is in the process of planning a major redevelopment of the area..
In 1974 , construction began on a $ 6 million shopping mall to be named Tanasbourne Town Center , located on the east side of Northwest 185th adjacent to the Sunset Highway .
This two-story , mall was completed in 1975 by owners Standard Insurance .
The original tenants included a library , a day care , professional offices and a three-screen movie theater named Town Center Cinemas .
A TriMet park-and-ride lot was constructed adjacent to the mall .
Tanasbourne Town Center also had an official alternative name of Tanasbourne Mall , which was commonly used by the public..
In 1988 , plans called for developing a shopping area around the mall that would have more than , including the mall .
The mall would also be renovated as part of the plan that included Standard selling part of their development , including the mall , to Pacific Rim Development Corporation..
In 1990 , a new outdoor shopping center was opened across 185th Avenue from the indoor mall .
Many of the mall 's tenants , such as anchors Safeway and PayLess Drug ( now Rite Aid ) , moved to the newer shopping center , creating vacancies in the enclosed mall .
The old building was torn down in 1993 and replaced with an outdoor shopping center that includes Target .
One of that shopping center 's original anchors was a Mervyn 's , but it closed in 2006 , with the space then divided for use by two smaller stores.. Tanasbourne sits at above sea-level .
Most of the community is within Hillsboro , and that city maintains a police station in the vicinity .
Hillsboro also has several parks in the area including Evergreen Park , Orchard Park , and Magnolia Park .
The area is split between the Hillsboro School District and the Beaverton School District..
The area is a regional shopping hub that includes the Tanasbourne Town Center , Tanasbourne Village , and The Streets of Tanasbourne .
Besides shopping centers , Tanasbourne is home to large apartment complexes , industrial/commercial parks , and many medical facilities .
Kaiser Permanente opened a new hospital , Kaiser Westside Medical Center , in the community in August 2013 .
Located in Oregon 's Silicon Forest , the area is home to EPSON 's Portland operation , a Netflix call center , a loan processing center for Bank of America , and OHSU 's West Campus..
Falling in Love ( Is Hard on the Knees ) .
`` Falling in Love ( Is Hard on the Knees ) '' is a song performed by American hard rock band Aerosmith that appeared on the band 's 1997 album `` Nine Lives '' .
The song was written by Steven Tyler , Joe Perry , and Glen Ballard , who had signed on to produce `` Nine Lives '' .
Although he was dropped from the role halfway through production and replaced by Kevin Shirley , Ballard was still credited for his contributions to the album ; he also co-wrote `` Pink '' with Tyler and Perry and `` Taste of India '' with Tyler and Richard Supa..

The song is certainly a rocking number , yet maintains the mainstream appeal found in the former `` Get a Grip '' singles .
The horns arrangements were written by lead singer Steven Tyler and David Campbell.. Tyler got the inspiration for the title off a bumper sticker he saw a few years previously .
The line `` But you like the way I hold the microphone '' was a reference to an almost identical line in The Rolling Stones ' 1965 song `` The Spider and the Fly '' ..
The song was a popular hit around the world , reaching number 35 on the US `` Billboard '' Hot 100 , number one on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and in Spain , number two in Canada , number 22 on the UK Singles Chart , and number 46 in Australia.. A music video was produced to promote the single .
The video was directed by Michael Bay , and had a surreal landscape described as `` '' 12 Monkeys '' meets `` Brazil '' '' , which was meant to parody grunge videos .
Many supermodels , such as Angie Everhart , are featured dressed as nurses , dominatrices and princesses..
The video for the song won the band a MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video in 1997..

A long black is a style of coffee commonly found in Australia and New Zealand .
It is similar to an Americano , but with a stronger aroma and taste.. A long black is made by pouring a double-shot of espresso or ristretto over hot water .
Typically about 100 - 120 milliliters of water is used ( 3.5 - 4 ounces ) but the measurement is considered to be flexible to individual taste .
The smaller volume of water compared to an Americano is responsible for its stronger taste .
Usually the water is also heated by the espresso machine .
Both retain the crema when brewed properly , though in the long black the crema will be more pronounced..
Richard Higham ( July 24 , 1851 – March 18 , 1905 ) was an American professional baseball player born in Ipswich , Suffolk , England .
However , he is best known as the only umpire to be banned from baseball..
He was born on July 24 , 1851 in Ipswich , England .
Higham 's family immigrated to the United States when he was two years old , and they settled in Hoboken , New Jersey.. During his career he was a very versatile player , fielding multiples positions , mainly as a right fielder and catcher with notable playing time as a second baseman as well .
In , he joined the New York Mutuals of the National Association during its inaugural season and played until the league was dissolved after the 1875 season , serving as player-manager in 1874 .
He then moved on to the newly formed National League , baseball 's first recognized major league , where he hit in the first NL triple play against the Mutuals on May 13 , .
In , he served as captain of the Syracuse Stars in the inaugural year of the International League , which was part of the League Alliance , with whom the National League had a working relationship.. After his playing days were over , he served as an umpire for two years ( though rumors abounded that he was fixing games as a player ) .
However , in , William G. Thompson , owner of the Detroit Wolverines ( and also mayor of Detroit ) got suspicious about some of the calls Higham made against his team .
He hired a private detective , who turned up several letters between Higham and a well-known gambler .
Higham outlined a simple code—if the gambler received a telegram from him saying `` Buy all the lumber you can '' , the gambler was to bet on Detroit .
No telegram meant that the gambler was to bet on his opponent.. As a result of this evidence , Higham was fired as an umpire and banned from baseball .
To date , he is the only umpire to have been banished from the game..
He moved back to Chicago , Illinois and became a bookkeeper .
It was here where he died and was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery.. .

Sândominic ( , : ) is a commune in Harghita County , Romania .
It lies in the Székely Land , an ethno-cultural region in eastern Transylvania .
It is composed of a single village , Sândominic.. At the 2011 census , the commune had a population of 6,110 ; out of them , 97 % were Hungarian , 1.4 % were Roma and 0.4 % were Romanian .
97 % of the commune population are Roman Catholic , 0.4 % are Orthodox , 0.4 % are Reformed and 0.1 % are Unitarian..
The name `` Sândominic '' is used for most official purposes , but the population usually uses the shortened form `` Domokos '' .. Sândominic is located in the upper reaches of the Olt valley , 29 kilometres north of Miercurea Ciuc .
The mountain pass to the northwest , leading to the village of Izvorul Mureșului ( ) and on to the large town of Gheorgheni , marks the northern boundary of the traditional region of Felcsík..
The northern reaches of the village follow the descent of the river Olt to the village centre .
Within the village limits , the Lok and Szádakút brooks meet the river , which then flows south to the village of Tomeşti .
In 1967 , the northern village of Bălan , long a part of the commune but by then more populous than the central village , gained official town status and was separated from Sândominic ; however , the two settlements still share important economic and transport links..
The village is served by the `` Izvorul Olt '' station of Romanian State Railways , on the Războieni-Târgu Mureș-Deda-Miercurea Ciuc-Sfântu Gheorghe-Brașov line..
There is evidence of Székely settlement on the site of Sândominic in the 14th century .
In the Middle Ages , the village was the site of iron and copper mining ( a tradition carried on until very recently in Bălan . )
The name `` Zent Damokos '' appears in a document from 1567 .
The village gained notoriety for an incident of 3 November 1599 at the field of Pásztorbükk .
On this day , Székely irregulars , allied in the Long War with Michael the Brave ( ) against the Hungarian nobility , killed the Cardinal András Báthory , Prince of Transylvania , who was retreating to Poland after being defeated in the Battle of Șelimbăr .
The murderers were Mihály András Kristály and Balázs Nagy ( later nicknamed Balázs Ördög - 'Balázs the Devil ' ) and they were executed for their deed .
Pope Clement VIII responded by placing the whole village under interdict .
Its location is at a distance of 5.5 km north of town , on south-eastern slope of the hill `` Fagul Ciobanului '' ( 1108 m ) .
The village administratively belonged to Csíkszék , then , from 1876 until 1918 to the Csík County of the Kingdom of Hungary .
In 1920 , Sândominic , like the rest of Transylvania , formally passed with the Treaty of Trianon from Hungarian to Romanian control .
The region passed again to Hungary with the 1940 Treaty of the Belvedere ( also known as the Second Vienna Award ) .
In 1944 , the village was the site of particularly bloody reprisals by Romanian irregulars participating in the recapture of Transylvania from this Hungarian control ; a small monument in the village 's central square bears witness to the 14 victims , among them an 86-year-old woman .
After World War II , it came under Romanian administration and became part of Romania in 1947 .
Between 1952 and 1960 , it formed part of the Hungarian Autonomous Province , then , of the Mureș-Hungarian Autonomous Province until it was abolished in 1968 .
Since then , the commune is part of Harghita County.. Sândominic 's Roman Catholic church was constructed between 1787 and 1802 , and still preserves numerous relics and treasures from the Middle Ages .
A Greek Catholic church was completed in 1787 , and there is also a small Romanian Orthodox church .
Numerous chapels are scattered around the village , including the chapel at Pásztorbükk.. A small village museum , containing historic farm equipment , costumes and weaponry , has been installed in the upper floor of the former House of Culture .
The lower floor retains its function as a meeting-hall and often hosts musical and theatrical events..
Examples of the famous `` Székely gates , '' richly carved wooden gates often several metres in height , can be seen throughout the village .
For this and other reasons , Sândominic has long attracted the attention of ethnologists and anthropologists.. .
N H Buchanan Motor Co Pty Ltd was an Australian kit car manufacturer .
The original body produced by Buchanan was a fibreglass item based on an Aston Martin DB3-S racing car .
Buchanan borrowed a DB3-S and pulled moulds from it while it was in Australia .
The styling was altered by filling in the scallops either side of the bonnet and reshaping the grille opening to be oval .
Because the target market was for rebodying of early model MGs , the Buchanan moulds were cut and extended between the door openings and the rear wheelarches , adding several centimetres to the body length..
Racing car kits were also produced , consisting of this type of body plus a fabricated X-frame racing chassis manufactured from steel channel sections welded face to face to form box sections .
The chassis used mechanicals from a Holden FJ , with the front suspension crossmember and rear axle assembly being shortened to suit the narrower body..
The Buchanan Cobra was introduced in 1958 as a production vehicle based on Standard 10 mechanicals .
Only 7 were manufactured.. Buchanan Cobra number 1 was known to be sitting in an industrial shed in Warners Bay awaiting restoration as at November 2006.. Buchanan Cobra number 3 is a complete running car and is raced through the Victorian Racing Register on a regular basis in Victoria as of May 2007 .
Attached is a current photograph of Cobra no.3 being raced at Sandown in November 2013. car is owned and driven by Paul Schilling a member of the Victorian Racing Register and residing at Healesville in Victoria .
Cobra number 3 has recently undergone a facelift , an engine rebuild , a paint job , electrical sorting and has appeared at Phillip Island , Sandown , Briant Park and Rob Roy hillclimbs and 2014 could be a big year for this cobra ... `` Wally Mitchell 's '' MGY-based Holden-powered Buchanan is currently undergoing a full ground up restoration by current owners Mathew Liersch and Clark Watson with an estimated completion date set for 2011..
MTSL ( `` S '' - ( 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-3-yl ) methyl methanesulfonothioate ) is an organosulfur compound that is used as a nitroxide spin label .
MTSL is bifunctional , consisting of the nitroxide and the thiosulfonate ester functional groups .
The nitroxide label is sterically protected , so it is relatively unreactive.. MTSL is attached to proteins by reaction with thiol groups .
Sulfinic acid ( CHSOH ) is the leaving group : .
The heterodisulfide bond to the cysteine residue is robust , enabling site-directed spin labelling .
The MTSL moiety will add 184.3 daltons to the mass of the protein or peptide to which it is attached .
The cysteine can be introduced using site-directed mutagenesis , and hence most positions in a protein can be labelled..
In Nuclear magnetic resonance the introduction of the paramagnetic group increases the relaxation rate of nearby nuclei .
Its presence can be detected as peak broadening and loss of intensity in peaks corresponding to nearby nuclei .
Hence proximity can be inferred for all nuclei , that are affected .
A major advantage of this method over traditional methods for obtaining distance restraints in protein NMR is the increased length , as paramagnetic relaxation enhancement can detect distances up to 25 Å ( 2.5 nm ) as opposed to about 6 Å ( 0.6 nm ) using the nuclear Overhauser effect .
Spin labelling with MTSL is frequently used in investigation of residual structure in intrinsically unstructured proteins..

San Sombrèro ( subtitled `` A Land of Carnivals , Cocktails and Coups '' ) is a parody travel guide book examining the eponymous fictional country , described as the birthplace of tinted sunglasses and sequins .
This country is set in Central America , and was created by Australian comedic writers Tom Gleisner , Santo Cilauro and Rob Sitch ( of `` The D-Generation '' and `` The Panel '' fame ) ..
In Spanish , San Sombrèro would be translated into English as `` Saint Hat '' , `` San '' being the shortened word for the Spanish word `` santo '' meaning saint , and `` sombrero '' ( no accent mark in real-world Spanish ) meaning hat..
According to the book the `` full and technically correct '' name of San Sombrèro is the `` Democratic Free People 's United Republic of San Sombrèro '' , and citizens may be arrested , without a warrant , if the title is `` not '' used..
The `` Democratic Free People ’ s United Republic of San Sombrèro '' is a composite of many stereotypes and clichés about Central America and South America .
It would be difficult to position the fictional San Sombèro on a map of Central America .
Although it is presented as a thin country between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea ( similar to Panama ) , it runs diagonally from northeast to southwest , in comparison to the other states on the Central American strip of land that run more from the northwest to southeast , or west to east .
If San Sombrèro were to be geographically placed it would probably fit best between Panama and Costa Rica..
The book says the nation has `` 362 separate public holidays ( not including the 'carnivale ' long weekend ) '' .
San Sombrèro appears to be a stereotypically corrupt and unstable banana republic with seemingly endless revolutions and counter-revolutions .
But there was a tribe that existed before called the `` Bollivquar '' , fierce warriors who regarded themselves as a very complex and advanced society , which is said to be odd because they `` never quite '' mastered fire , irrigation or star jumps .
But they learnt how to farm tobacco , which to this day still remains a part of the Bollivquar diet , explaining their stunted growth .
Note that their inability to light a fire made it harder to take up smoking.. San Sombrèro is a Spanish-speaking country , but a dialect has developed known as San Sombrèran , which combines Castilian grammar , Portuguese pronunciation , and indigenous shouting .
San Sombrèran Spanish is spoken a lot faster than normal Spanish , because it is considered impolite for people to take a breath during a sentence ( particularly since their breath is so foul ) .
San Sombrèran Spanish has many English loanwords , some of which are `` beisbol '' - baseball , `` hamburgesa '' - hamburger ( these two are actual Spanish words ) , `` beeras '' - beers , and `` dryvebyshooting '' - drive by shooting..
The San Sombrèran national anthem is `` O Patria Gloriosa '' ( O Glorious Motherland ) , written in 1853 by independence leader Juan Robirro , who is famous for uttering `` He who loves his country , lives forever '' shortly before falling off a ladder and dying .
The national anthem is set to a bossa nova beat , and loyal citizens of San Sombrèro will stand respectfully , place a hand on each hip and start to gyrate while the anthem is played.. .
The flag of San Sombrèro is the `` Camouflagio '' , which resembles military camouflage , with a narrow vertical white stripe on the left side .
When the nation first became independent from Spain a dirty red and white chequered tablecloth made an impromptu flag..
The capital city of San Sombrèro is Cucaracha City in Polluçión .
There are five provinces in San Sombrèro including Polluçión , the other provinces are : .
The book advertises ( fictional ) guides on the following places : Unaudited Arab Emirates ( the Middle East ) , Costa Lottsa ( akin to Monaco ) , the Barbituros Islands ( the Caribbean ) , Alpenstein ( the Alps ) , Tyranistan ( Former Soviet Union ) , Nuku'la Atoll ( Polynesia ) , frozen Norgborg ( Scandinavia ) , and the miserable Isle of Fogg ( North Sea ) .
It also advertises its website 's forum , as well as world tours for botanists and golfers , and an opportunity to spend a year in an untouched part of Europe..

Nilsson 's playing in Sundsvall had again attracted attention , this time from Allsvenska AIK , who made a deal with GIF Sundsvall that Per Nilsson would move to the club prior to the 2002 season in 2001 , however due to a series of different circumstances , as several key players left AIK , made AIK change the deal so that he could join the club already in the autumn of 2001 .
Following his debut against IFK Norrköping he quickly established himself as a regular central defender , however a series of manager changes and other events made Per feel that he could not perform at top level..
Following AIK 's poor performance during the 2004 season saw the club relegated from Allsvenskan and Per Nilsson leave the club for Norwegian club Odd Grenland for approximately 3 million Norwegian kroner .
Odd Grenland rejected a £1 million offer from English side Sunderland AFC in August 2006 .
It was widely expected that he would leave for a bigger club , however no bids came until 13 July 2007 when it was announced that Nilsson signed a contract with 2 .
On 14 July 2010 , Hoffenheim confirmed that they had sold Nilsson to Bundesliga rival 1 .
FC Nürnberg.. On 23 March 2014 , the Danish club FC Copenhagen announced that they had signed Nilsson on a three-year contract .
On December 15 , 2016 , Nilsson officially announced his retirement as a player.. .

Bantsuma , birth name Denkichi Tamura , was born in Kodenmachō , Nihonbashi , Tokyo .
Bantsuma 's father , a cotton wholesaler named Chōgorō , lived till the age of 71 but his mother , older brother , and sister died when he was young .
He attended Jisshi Elementary School ( which stands next to the former site of Denma-chō Prison where many the loyal supporters of the Emperor , whom he frequently played in his films , were deeply involved ) .
At school , he was often the leader of the pack and was actively involved in plays .
While performing in a school play , Bantsuma froze on stage , unable to recite his lines .
Embarrassed , he ran off and stayed in his room , weeping for 10 days .
It is said that during this time , he vowed to become someone who would be admired by all.. After the death of his mother , his father 's business soon went bankrupt and Bantsuma was unable to continue his education .
After finishing elementary school , he became an apprentice and pupil to Kataoka Nizaemon , a famous kabuki actor .
However , in the world of kabuki , lineage was extremely important and Bantsuma struggled to gain fame .
He soon changed his artistic direction by joining small theaters and taking small roles at Kokkatsu production firm .
In 1922 , with Kichimatsu Nakamura , he formed the “ Bando Tsumasaburo Troupe , ” but it was disbanded very quickly .
In 1923 , Bantsuma and Kichimatsu were scouted into the film industry by Makino Film Studio.. Once he joined Makino Film Productions , he began to build a celebrated career as an actor .
It was during this period that he became best friends with Rokuhei Susukita , a script writer who wrote almost a hundred scripts for the Makino studio .
He introduced complex plot lines , exhilarating action sequences , and unruly anarchy to jidaigeki films , very much in the style of American films .
Rokuhei subsequently selected Bantsuma to debut in his film `` Gyakuryo '' in 1924 , a story about a poor , low-rank samurai whose life is turned upside down by his enemy .
In 1925 , Bantsuma starred in `` Kageboshi '' , another screenplay written by Rokuhei , this time depicting the life of the ‘ jovial thief ’ , Kageboshi.. At the height of his fame , Bantsuma established his own agency in the summer of 1925 .
It was the first independent production company to be headed by a film star in the history of Japanese cinema .
Bantsuma owned most of the rights and would go through the specific scenes and details with the directors .
He is said to have been very demanding but his colleagues have explained that this was merely a reflection of his eager and enthusiastic approach to making films .
During this time , Bantsuma practically lived in Gion being entertained by geisha .
It is also well known that he liked to flaunt his cash and he often treated his co-workers to a night in Gion with sometimes up to 20 geisha in one room .
In 1926 Bantsuma built a studio outside Kyoto where the Toei Kyoto studio now stands.. By far the most controversial film made under Bantsuma Productions was its second production , `` Orochi '' ( 1925 ) .
The story revolves around the protagonist , Heizaburo Kuritomi , an honorable but low-class samurai who is given an emotional depth , previously unseen in jidaigeki films , as he battles with inner conflict and the injustices of society .
This is especially evident in the closing sequence of the film where the protagonist is dragged away by his enemies after his tremendous effort to protect his love .
In the essay , `` Bantsuma 's 'New Breeze ' '' , Midori Sawato cites the ending of `` Orochi '' as one of the most 'heroic and heart-crushing ' images she has seen .
In the past , the heroes of the films were proud samurai of the upper classes who always triumphed over their evil opponents , upholding what was truly right in the world .
However , `` Orochi '' was created in response to the national and military fanaticism that was prevailing at the time.. With its now-famous opening lines : ‘ Not all those who wear the name of villain , are truly evil men .
Not all those who are respected as noble men , are worthy of the name .
Many are those who wear a false mask of benevolence to hide their treachery and the wickedness of their true selves , ’ the film evoked provocative ideologies and rebellious ideas during a time where liberal performers and writers were being repressed throughout Japan .
Consequently , the film was severely censored with over 20 % of its content being completely cut out and several scenes having to be re-shot .
When the film was finally released , the hype around its creation resulted in crowds flocking to theaters all around the country .
Bantsuma 's exhilarating new sword fighting style he displayed in the film may have attracted audiences but it can not be denied that there were many who were also deeply touched by the profound message of the film.. Bantsuma went on to produce many films under his production company , but `` Orochi '' was the only one he personally kept the negative for .
His agency hit a low point during the period 1931–1935 .
During this time , his production company was very much a ‘ one-man agency ’ , where the directors were only acting to please Bantsuma .
His acting skills gradually became old and outdated so his films did not do very well .
In 1935 , Bantsuma worked with the renowned director Hiroshi Inagaki in his first talkie film , `` Niino Tsuruchiyo '' ( 1935 ) , but his rather feeble voice was unpopular with the audience .
It seemed that Bantsuma 's luck was running out and in 1936 he closed the doors of his agency once and for all , and joined Nikkatsu Production Company in 1937.. Bantsuma 's films , particularly his earlier works , would not be complete without the fast-paced sword fighting scenes that always guaranteed to raise the heart rate of his audience .
Fighting styles had always been set , especially in Kabuki performances and actors were limited to doing standard moves such as the 'Yamagata ' , 'Yanagi ' , or the 'Chijihataka ' .
However , with the emergence of Bantsuma this changed and he introduced a completely new style which was unique to him alone .
Ryu Kuze , a sword fighting coach analyzed Bantsuma 's technique and put his uniqueness down to the fact that he does not look at his victims when he slays them .
Instead , he is already focused on his next victim .
Ryu Kuze also pointed out that Bantsuma would stand straight with his ankles lined up which was his signature pose that signaled death for his opponent .
His colleagues often spoke of their admiration for Bantsuma 's enthusiasm and quick ability to pick up new moves and sequences .
Bantsuma 's spectacular sword skills soon earned him the title , ‘ The King of Swordfights. ’ .
Bantsuma 's first son , Takahiro Tamura , described his father as ‘ sensitive ’ and affected by everything occurring around him .
He wrote several articles for magazines such as `` Bantsuma Cinema News '' and displayed his sensitivity , as well as giving the audience an insight into his mentality..
In the November 1929 issue of `` Bantsuma Cinema News '' , he wrote , ‘ The life of an artist is to die for art .
Only when art is one ’ s life can one produce real art .
As I have a long way to go , I will continue down this path while with such belief. ’ .
His determination and dedication in what he did is evident in the statement he made in the February 1930 issue of the same magazine .
He wrote , ‘ When creating such a film , I am not an actor , but actually am in the shoes of the character in the film , feeling what he feels , and I suffer the same agony as that character .
I must play numerous characters and their diverse personalities one after another .
Sometimes I feel myself screaming inside…you can not claim with confidence that you are speaking the mind of the character with only a half-developed understanding of that character .
Being able to fully depict the character comes only after bleeding and suffering in agony in the process. ’ .
Bantsuma was truly a man of many talents.. Bantsuma and his wife Shizuko Tamura had four sons together — Takahiro Tamura , Masakazu Tamura , Ryō Tamura , and Toshima Tamura .
Three followed in their father 's footsteps , launching careers in the movie industry .
Toshima became a businessperson.. His first son , Takahiro Tamura ( who died on 16 May 2006 from a cerebral infarction ) , often spoke fondly about his father in interviews and gave valuable insights..
The family often spent their summers at the beach in Amanohashidate and , as Takahiro recalled , Bantsuma would splash around in the water , even more excited than his brothers .
He also spoke of the memory of his father 's reaction to the results of his junior high school examination .
Too nervous to go to the school and check , the good news was delivered by the teacher .
Takahiro distinctly remembered his father bounding down the stairs and bowing in front of the teacher till his forehead touched the floor , almost as if shooting a scene from one of his jidaigeki films..
Many people think that Bantsuma 's true nature can be seen in `` Yabure Daiko '' ( 1949 ) , where he plays the role of a tyrannical man feared by his family .
He was the complete opposite , always putting his family first .
The role he played in `` Abare Jishi '' of a father who would do anything for his children is a more accurate representation of Bantsuma , who was an affectionate and well-rounded family man .
However , Bantsuma 's dedication to his work was also strong , and he returned to the set , ready to work , the day after his wedding..
It seems that Bantsuma 's sensitivity was beginning to make its way into the work he was producing .
A year after entering Nikkatsu , Bantsuma co-starred with Kataoka Chiezo in the all-star film , `` Chushingura '' ( 1938 ) .
Playing the role of Kuranosuke Oishi , Bantsuma displayed his perfected acting skills with his powerful performance .
Then in 1943 he starred in the film `` Muho matsu no Issho '' , playing a poor rickshaw man .
It was a role that would not normally have been taken on by such a great star but director Hiroshi Inagaki , whom Bantsuma had previously worked with , was determined to get him on board .
After initially turning down the role , Bantsuma finally agreed and went on to play a role with a profound humanistic approach that lent great depth to both the character and the movie .
In preparation for the role of the poor rickshaw man , Bantsuma stayed in character even whilst at home .
His first son , Takahiro Tamura described watching his father eat dried fish and drink sake in the style of the character of the film.. During this period of his career , Japan soon lost the war and the US army began to restrict Jidaigeki as a ‘ hotbed of feudalism. ’ Thus , the stars of Jidaigeki formed troupes and traveled around the country .
During this time , Bantsuma perfected his skills further and in 1948 he peaked once again with his performance in the film `` Ōshō '' .
Director Daisuke Itō spoke of Bantsuma 's wide range and depth , his convincing and humanistic portrayal of the protagonist , and stated that despite his big status in the film industry , Bantsuma was the obvious choice for the part of Sankichi , a man of the lowest social ranks.. On 7 July 1953 , Bantsuma died at the age of 51 of cerebral hemorrhage while filming `` Abare-Jishi '' .
A grave has been built in his memory in Nisonin , Kyoto and Bantsuma lives on through the continued popularity of his films and the impact he made to the history of Japanese cinema.. .

The Shire of Waroona is a local government area in the Peel region of Western Australia between Mandurah and Harvey and about 110 kilometres ( 68 mi ) south of Perth , the state capital .
The Shire covers an area of about 835 km² ( 322 mi² ) and its seat of government is the town of Waroona..
The Drakesbrook Road District was established on 29 April 1898 , seceding from the larger Murray Road District .
The road district maintained the Drakesbrook name for some years after the town itself was renamed , but on 1 July 1961 it was declared a shire as the Shire of Waroona following the passage of the `` Local Government Act 1960 '' , which reformed all remaining road districts into shires..
The shire no longer has wards , it is made up of eight councillors who represent the whole of the Shire..
The Shire of Waroona contains the following towns and localities : .
National parks and state forests based around both the Yalgorup lakes and the Darling Scarp jarrah forests occupy approximately half the land area of the Shire.. As of 2020 , 37 places are heritage-listed in the Shire of Waroona , of which four are on the State Register of Heritage Places..
Trichoptilosis ( from the Greek τριχο- `` tricho- '' `` hair '' and the New Latin `` ptilosis '' `` arrangement of feathers in definite areas '' from the Greek πτίλον `` ptilon '' `` feather '' ) , schizotrichia , and informally split ends , is the splitting or fraying of the hair-shaft due to excessive heat and mechanical stress..
Thermal , chemical or mechanical stress can cause split ends .
For example , the use of curling irons and other heat treatments may cause split ends .
Excessive application of hair products such as perms and hair coloring may strip protective layering off the outside of the hair 's shaft and weaken the hair , making the hair prone to split ends .
Mechanical stresses include pulling a comb forcefully through tangled hair and repeated combing .
Split ends can be a symptom of copper transport disorders such as Menkes disease and occipital horn syndrome .
Rubbing the hair up towards the scalp does not cause split ends..
There is no remedy for split ends beyond trimming the affected hair..
Some products claim to heal split ends by sealing the ends back together.. Reducing or eliminating the causes will usually prevent split ends .
Trimming the ends of the hair at least every 6– 10 weeks may prevent split ends .
Also , hair at the highest risk for splitting can be removed..
Mestranol , sold under the brand names Enovid , Norinyl , and Ortho-Novum among others , is an estrogen medication which has been used in birth control pills , menopausal hormone therapy , and the treatment of menstrual disorders .
It is formulated in combination with a progestin and is not available alone .
It is taken by mouth.. Side effects of mestranol include nausea , breast tension , edema , and breakthrough bleeding among others .
It is an estrogen , or an agonist of the estrogen receptors , the biological target of estrogens like estradiol .
Mestranol is a prodrug of ethinylestradiol in the body.. Mestranol was discovered in 1956 and was introduced for medical use in 1957 .
It was the estrogen component in the first birth control pill .
In 1969 , mestranol was replaced by ethinylestradiol in most birth control pills , although mestranol continues to be used in a few birth control pills even today .
Mestranol remains available only in a few countries , including the United States , United Kingdom , Japan , and Chile.. Mestranol was employed as the estrogen component in many of the first oral contraceptives , such as mestranol/noretynodrel ( brand name `` Enovid '' ) and mestranol/norethisterone ( brand names `` Ortho-Novum '' , `` Norinyl '' ) , and is still in use today .
In addition to its use as an oral contraceptive , mestranol has been used as a component of menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms.. Mestranol is a biologically inactive prodrug of ethinylestradiol to which it is demethylated in the liver with a conversion efficiency of 70 % ( 50 μg of mestranol is pharmacokinetically bioequivalent to 35 μg of ethinylestradiol ) .
It has been found to possess 0.1 to 2.3 % of the relative binding affinity of estradiol ( 100 % ) for the estrogen receptor , compared to 75 to 190 % for ethinylestradiol..
The elimination half-life of mestranol has been reported to be 50 minutes .
The elimination half-life of the active form of mestranol , ethinylestradiol , is 7 to 36 hours..
The effective ovulation-inhibiting dosage of mestranol has been studied in women .
It has been reported to be about 98 % effective at inhibiting ovulation at a dosage of 75 or 80 μg/day .
In another study , the ovulation rate was 15.4 % at 50 μg/day , 5.7 % at 80 μg/day , and 1.1 % at 100 μg/day.. Mestranol , also known as ethinylestradiol 3-methyl ether ( EEME ) or as 17α-ethynyl-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5 ( 10 ) -trien-17β-ol , is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol .
It is specifically a derivative of ethinylestradiol ( 17α-ethynylestradiol ) with a methyl ether at the C3 position..
In April 1956 , noretynodrel was investigated , in Puerto Rico , in the first large-scale clinical trial of a progestogen as an oral contraceptive .
The trial was conducted in Puerto Rico due to the high birth rate in the country and concerns of moral censure in the United States .
It was discovered early into the study that the initial chemical syntheses of noretynodrel had been contaminated with small amounts ( 1–2 % ) of the 3-methyl ether of ethinylestradiol ( noretynodrel having been synthesized from ethinylestradiol ) .
When this impurity was removed , higher rates of breakthrough bleeding occurred .
As a result , mestranol , that same year ( 1956 ) , was developed and serendipitously identified as a very potent synthetic estrogen ( and eventually as a prodrug of ethinylestradiol ) , given its name , and added back to the formulation .
This resulted in Enovid by G. D. Searle & Company , the first oral contraceptive and a combination of 9.85 mg noretynodrel and 150 μg mestranol per pill.. Around 1969 , mestranol was replaced by ethinylestradiol in most combined oral contraceptives due to widespread panic about the recently uncovered increased risk of venous thromboembolism with estrogen-containing oral contraceptives .
The rationale was that ethinylestradiol was approximately twice as potent by weight as mestranol and hence that the dose could be halved , which it was thought might result in a lower incidence of venous thromboembolism .
Whether this actually did result in a lower incidence of venous thromboembolism has never been assessed.. `` Mestranol '' is the generic name of the drug and its , , , , , and , while `` mestranolo '' is its .. Mestranol has been marketed under a variety of brand names , mostly or exclusively in combination with progestins , including Devocin , Enavid , Enovid , Femigen , Mestranol , Norbiogest , Ortho-Novin , Ortho-Novum , Ovastol , and Tranel among others .
Today , it continues to be sold in combination with progestins under brand names including Lutedion , Necon , Norinyl , Ortho-Novum , and Sophia.. Mestranol remains available only in the United States , the United Kingdom , Japan , and Chile .
It is only marketed in combination with progestins , such as norethisterone.. Mestranol has been studied as a male contraceptive and was found to be highly effective .
At a dosage of 0.45 mg/day , it suppressed gonadotropin levels , reduced sperm count to zero within 4 to 6 weeks , and decreased libido , erectile function , and testicular size .
These findings contributed to the conclusion that estrogens would be unacceptable as contraceptives for men..
The pataria was an eleventh-century movement focused on the city of Milan in northern Italy , which aimed to reform the clergy and ecclesiastic government within the city and its ecclesiastical province , in support of Papal sanctions against simony and clerical marriage .
Those involved in the movement were called patarini ( singular `` patarino '' ) , patarines or patarenes , a word chosen by their opponents , the etymology of which is unclear .
The movement , associated with urban unrest in the city of Milan , is generally considered to have begun in 1057 and ended in 1075..
Early in the year 1057 , a preacher named Ariald arrived in the city of Milan and began to preach against the Milanese clerics ' custom of marrying .
It is possible that he took advantage of the absence at this time of the Archbishop of Milan , Guido , who was in Germany in August at the Council of Tribur..
The Milanese clergy grew concerned by Ariald 's attempt to whip up the city against them , and sent envoys to Pope Stephen IX in Rome .
On hearing this , Ariald travelled to Rome himself .
Pope Stephen IX was sympathetic to Ariald 's position , and sent two envoys to Milan , Hildebrand ( later Pope Gregory VII ) and Anselm of Baggio ( later Pope Alexander II ) .
Ariald also returned to Milan , and now began to criticise the Milanese clerics ' practice of simony , resulting in urban unrest .
Ariald 's close associate Landulf Cotta was attacked , and later died from his injuries..
In 1059 Ariald travelled to Rome again to seek advice ; Pope Stephen IX again sent envoys to Milan , this time Peter Damian and again Anselm of Baggio , but this did nothing to quell the unrest in the city .
In 1063 , Landulf Cotta 's brother Erlembald went to Rome where he obtained a papal banner from the newly elected Pope Alexander II in support of the Pataria movement .
In 1066 , Pope Alexander II finally excommunicated Archbishop Guido .
Guido used this excommunication however to whip up the citizens ' anger against the Paterenes at a public meeting , and Ariald was first chased out of the city of Milan , and then assassinated , in June 1066..
However , when Ariald 's body was found in May 1067 , it quickly became the object of a cult , and popular opinion in Milan swung back behind the Pataria .
Archbishop Guido was forced out of the city , leaving it under the control of Erlembald , and Alexander II formally proclaimed Ariald to be a saint in 1068.. Archbishop Guido resigned in 1068 , in favour of his associate Gotofredo da Castiglione , who was also supported by Emperor Henry IV .
The papacy and the Pataria however supported a different candidate as archbishop , Attone , and Pope Gregory VII excommunicated Gotofredo in 1074..
Rioting in Milan led to the murder of Erlembald in 1075 , and after this point the Pataria movement lost much of its energy .
The controversy over the appointment of the archbishop of Milan continued , however , and contributed to the political tensions between Emperor Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII..
There are several contemporary and nearly-contemporary sources for the Pataria , each of which offers different and sometimes contradictory perspectives .
As Paolo Golinelli has emphasised , modern debates about the Pataria have often centred on whether the Pataria was primarily a religious movement , or whether it was instead the religious expression of social tensions within the city and region of Milan .
The Italian historian Gioacchino Volpe , for instance , argued in 1907 that the Pataria was a class conflict between the elites of Milan and the lower-status population .
This interpretation was also supported by Ernst Werner in 1956 .
For Hagen Keller , the Pataria is best understood as part of the history of the emergence of the Italian commune.. More recently , historians such as Herbert Cowdrey have emphasised the movement 's essentially religious nature .
Many historians have associated the movement with wider reforming trends in the Church .
For William North , the Pataria was 'the longest ... and most violent of the popular responses to the call for ecclesiastical reform in the eleventh century ' .
In his article on religious change in the eleventh century , R.I. Moore discussed the Pataria extensively as a major part of the 'appearance of the crowd on the stage of public events ' , which he sees as being brought into being by religious reform ( itself however a response to social change ) ..
In a recent article , Piroska Nagy has suggested a new path of interpretation by analysing the collective emotions of the movement..
In mathematics , Siegel modular forms are a major type of automorphic form .
These generalize conventional `` elliptic '' modular forms which are closely related to elliptic curves .
The complex manifolds constructed in the theory of Siegel modular forms are Siegel modular varieties , which are basic models for what a moduli space for abelian varieties ( with some extra level structure ) should be and are constructed as quotients of the Siegel upper half-space rather than the upper half-plane by discrete groups .
Siegel modular forms are holomorphic functions on the set of symmetric `` n '' × `` n '' matrices with positive definite imaginary part ; the forms must satisfy an automorphy condition .
Siegel modular forms can be thought of as multivariable modular forms , i.e .
as special functions of several complex variables.. Siegel modular forms were first investigated by for the purpose of studying quadratic forms analytically .
These primarily arise in various branches of number theory , such as arithmetic geometry and elliptic cohomology .
Siegel modular forms have also been used in some areas of physics , such as conformal field theory and black hole thermodynamics in string theory.. Let formula_1 and define .
Define the symplectic group of level formula_3 , denoted by formula_4 as .
be a rational representation , where formula_9 is a finite-dimensional complex vector space..
is a `` Siegel modular form '' of degree formula_14 ( sometimes called the genus ) , weight formula_15 , and level formula_3 if .
In the case that formula_19 , we further require that formula_20 be holomorphic 'at infinity ' .
This assumption is not necessary for formula_21 due to the Koecher principle , explained below .
Denote the space of weight formula_15 , degree formula_14 , and level formula_3 Siegel modular forms by .
Some methods for constructing Siegel modular forms include : .
For degree 1 , the level 1 Siegel modular forms are the same as level 1 modular forms .
The ring of such forms is a polynomial ring C [ `` E '' , '' E '' ] in the ( degree 1 ) Eisenstein series `` E '' and `` E '' .. For degree 2 , showed that the ring of level 1 Siegel modular forms is generated by the ( degree 2 ) Eisenstein series `` E '' and `` E '' and 3 more forms of weights 10 , 12 , and 35 .
The ideal of relations between them is generated by the square of the weight 35 form minus a certain polynomial in the others.. For degree 3 , described the ring of level 1 Siegel modular forms , giving a set of 34 generators.. For degree 4 , the level 1 Siegel modular forms of small weights have been found .
There are no cusp forms of weights 2 , 4 , or 6 .
The space of cusp forms of weight 8 is 1-dimensional , spanned by the Schottky form .
The space of cusp forms of weight 10 has dimension 1 , the space of cusp forms of weight 12 has dimension 2 , the space of cusp forms of weight 14 has dimension 3 , and the space of cusp forms of weight 16 has dimension 7 .. For degree 5 , the space of cusp forms has dimension 0 for weight 10 , dimension 2 for weight 12 .
The space of forms of weight 12 has dimension 5.. For degree 6 , there are no cusp forms of weights 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 .
The space of Siegel modular forms of weight 2 has dimension 0 , and those of weights 4 or 6 both have dimension 1.. For small weights and level 1 , give the following results ( for any positive degree ) : .
The following table combines the results above with information from and and ..
The theorem known as the `` Koecher principle '' states that if formula_20 is a Siegel modular form of weight formula_15 , level 1 , and degree formula_21 , then formula_20 is bounded on subsets of formula_30 of the form .
Corollary to this theorem is the fact that Siegel modular forms of degree formula_21 have Fourier expansions and are thus holomorphic at infinity..
In the D1D5P system of supersymmetric black holes in string theory , the function that naturally captures the microstates of black hole entropy is a Siegel modular form .
In general , Siegel modular forms have been described as having the potential to describe black holes or other gravitational systems.. Siegel modular forms also have uses as generating functions for families of CFT2 with increasing central charge in conformal field theory , particularly the hypothetical AdS/CFT correspondence..
Just Missed the Train is a Danielle Brisebois compilation album released on September 26 , 2006 .
It contains numerous tracks from her 1994 debut `` Arrive All Over You '' and the rare B-sides `` Sinking Slow '' , `` Pretty Baby '' , and an acoustic version of `` Just Missed the Train '' ..
( ) is the debut studio album by Mexican Pop rock singer Gloria Trevi .
It was produced by Sergio Andrade and originally released in 1989 by Sony International .
The album became massively popular with the mainstream Mexican audience because of songs such as `` Dr. Psiquiatra '' , `` Satisfecha '' , `` Ultimo Beso '' , and `` Mañana '' .
This album is noted for using two popular English language songs : `` Last Kiss '' and `` Satisfaction '' , but both songs were sung in Spanish ( in the version of a woman to a man , as Trevi would later described it ) .
These songs ( tracks four and five ) were perfectly translated into Spanish and became very popular , helping the album sell over 2,000,000 copies..
`` Pink '' is a song by American rock band Aerosmith .
It was written by Steven Tyler and professional songwriters Richie Supa and Glen Ballard .
It was released as the third major single from `` Nine Lives '' in 1997..
27 on the `` Billboard '' Hot 100 , No .
It also topped the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for four weeks..
The band re-released the song in the United Kingdom in 1999 .
The re-released version did much better , reaching No .
The song is highlighted by a harmonica performance by Steven Tyler at the beginning , as well as a strong bass rhythm throughout the song , and a mix of acoustic guitars and jangling electric guitars throughout the verses..
Many of the lines in the verses start with the word `` pink '' ( e.g .
`` Pink it 's my new obsession `` , `` Pink it 's not even a question '' , `` Pink on the lips of your lover '' ) .
The song is also highly suggestive , in that the origin of the fascination with pink stems from the admiration of a woman 's reproductive organs , particularly the inner side of the outer lips – the `` pink in the middle '' – and also the man 's penis – `` I wan na wrap you in rubber '' and `` my favorite crayon '' ..
The music video for the song used CGI to morph characters ' faces to other bodies .
A variety of random characters mixed in with band members moving towards the camera , morphing into different characters in the process ( e.g. , Joe Perry as a centaur , Brad Whitford as a little boy , Steven Tyler as a skeleton , and a boy dressed as the Easter Bunny ) .
It was directed by Doug Nichol.. Two versions of the music video exist .
In the uncensored version , there is a woman dressed in a blue jumpsuit walking towards the camera .
For a brief second , the top , unzipped portion of the jumpsuit is pulled away , revealing her right breast .
There is another instance where a woman 's breasts are briefly fully revealed when a woman , painted blue and green , does a pirouette..
The uncensored version caused minor controversy and MTV asked Nichol to censor the video for daytime airings .
As a result , the edited version censored the pirouette scene .
The clean version also shows Tyler and Perry presented as a two-headed man and only the coverup portion of the breast reveal scene is present..
The 1997 release cover art had the Aerosmith logo drawn as if it were by a child , in a pink background .
In the 1999 re-release , the cover art features the Aerosmith logo and eight stills from the music video.. That 's the original logo.. As of 2007 , `` Pink '' is one of only two songs from `` Nine Lives '' consistently played on Aerosmith tours , along with `` Falling in Love ( Is Hard on the Knees ) '' .. A different version of the song , The South Beach Re-Mix , was included on the career-spanning compilation `` O , Yeah !
